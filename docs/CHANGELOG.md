# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- [Changed]: [2026-06-07] Benchmark test parameters — moved `context_length`, `gpu_layer_offload`, `batch_size`, `u_batch_size`, and `cache_ram` (plus their step/max values) from hardcoded constants in `index.js` to a new `test_params` section in `configs.json` for centralized configuration
- [Changed]: [2026-06-07] Benchmark iteration bounds — `updateConfigs()` now caps all test variables at their configured maximums via `Math.min()` instead of unbounded increments; added `areAllVariablesAtMax()` to detect when all variables have reached their limits
- [Changed]: [2026-06-07] Benchmark result reporting — `writeResultsToMarkdown()` now runs after each test iteration for incremental reporting, not just at the end of the benchmark

### Fixed

- [Fixed]: [2026-06-07] Benchmark variable typo — renamed `cacheRamSMax` to `cacheRamMax` for consistency with other max variable names

### Added

- [Added]: [2026-06-07] Skip build option — added `skip_build` config flag and `--no-build` CLI argument to skip llama.cpp compilation; `startLlamaServer()` now uses `spawn()` with `shell: true` instead of manual command parsing; added `buildParams` cache variable to reduce repeated `configs.build_make_params` access; changed `llama_host` to 100.105.3.99

- [Added]: [2026-06-07] Image attachment support — drag & drop or click 📷 to attach up to 10 images (max 10MB each), with automatic compression (1920px max, JPEG 80% quality), inline thumbnails in chat, and base64 data URL transmission to the agent
- [Added]: [2026-06-07] Betty web frontend — a browser-based chat interface for the pi coding agent with real-time streaming, thinking block display, tool call visibility, code block rendering with copy buttons, dark theme, responsive design, auto-reconnect, session management, and model/thinking level controls
- [Added]: [2026-06-07] Right-aligned user message bubbles in chat — user messages now appear on the right with reversed header layout and adjusted bubble corner radii for a familiar chat UI
- [Added]: [2026-06-07] Command palette in chat input — type `/` to open a searchable command list with keyboard navigation, 6 built-in shortcuts (help, shortcuts, clear, compact, export, new), and live filtering against backend-provided commands

### Removed

- [Removed]: [2026-06-07] Deleted local `.pi/agents/` and `.pi/skills/` files (reviewer.md, scout.md, worker.md, and all skill definitions and references)

### Added

- [Added]: [2026-06-07] Workspace selector — sidebar 📁 button opens a directory browser modal to select which project directory the agent works in, with `WORKSPACE` environment variable for default, agent restart on change, and file icons for common project files

### Refactored

- [Changed]: [2026-06-07] Restructured project from flat layout to `src/` directory — moved `server.js` to `src/backend/server.js`, `public/index.html` to `src/frontend/public/index.html`, and `templates/project_template.md` to `src/frontend/templates/project_template.md`; updated backend path references and package.json scripts accordingly

### Added

- [Added]: [2026-06-07] llama.cpp benchmark tool (`src/benchmark/`) — automated benchmark runner that starts llama-server, sends 4 context-filling messages per test run via the `/completion` endpoint, measures total time in ms, prompt tokens/sec, and generation tokens/sec per message, logs server parameters and environment variables, writes results to `results.md` as markdown tables, and loops through config iterations (doubling context, incrementing batch/ubatch/cache sizes)
- [Added]: [2026-06-07] Benchmark config file (`src/benchmark/configs.json`) — configurable model path, CUDA build flags, model inference params (temp, top-p, top-k), multi-GPU tensor split, and llama-server runtime options
- [Added]: [2026-06-07] `axios` and `dotenv` dependencies for HTTP requests and environment variable loading in the benchmark tool

### Fixed

- [Fixed]: [2026-06-07] llama.cpp build — cmake now runs in the correct directory (`llama.cpp/`) with proper `cwd` and `env` options instead of relying on shell `export` commands that don't persist between `exec()` calls; added binary existence verification after build
- [Fixed]: [2026-06-07] llama-server spawn `ENOENT` — removed dead `export VAR=val` prefix from command string; added `cwd` to `spawn()` pointing to the binary directory; env vars now passed via spawn's `env` option
- [Fixed]: [2026-06-07] Build error messages were swallowed — `runCommand` rejected with `{ error, stderr }` but catch blocks accessed `error.message` (undefined on plain objects); now properly extracts and displays both error message and stderr
- [Fixed]: [2026-06-07] `isCloned()` — now uses `fs.statSync` to verify `llama.cpp` is a directory, not just a name in the listing

### Added

- [Added]: [2026-06-07] Verbose error display — `runBuild`, `init`, and `main` now show formatted error blocks with separator lines, stderr output, and helpful context (working directory, build cores, build directory contents)
- [Added]: [2026-06-07] 10-error limit — benchmark stops after 10 test run failures; error count displayed as `error N/10` in console output
- [Added]: [2026-06-07] `npm run benchmark` script in `package.json` to run the benchmark tool
- [Added]: [2026-06-07] Server parameters in `configs.json` — `server_params` section with `enabled`/`value` pattern for all llama-server flags (flash_attn, reasoning, profiling, presence_penalty, reasoning_budget, reasoning_budget_message, rope_scaling, jinja, parallel, n_predict, n_keep, stream, cache_prompt, cont_batching)
- [Added]: [2026-06-07] Split parameters in `configs.json` — `split_params` section with `enabled`/`value` pattern for layer_split, tensor_split, and primary_gpu

### Changed

- [Changed]: [2026-06-07] Benchmark config — disabled layer_split, tensor_split, primary_gpu, n_predict, and n_keep split params; added gpu_layers split param (value: 999); updated CUDA version from 13.3 to 13.2
- [Changed]: [2026-06-07] Benchmark build script — refactored `getBuildScript()` to use an array of flags instead of string concatenation, with improved logging of cmake flags and full command; fixed `CUDACXX` env var to only be set when present in process.env
- [Changed]: [2026-06-07] Benchmark server params — added `gpuLayers` to server params snapshot and test run configuration

### Added

- [Added]: [2026-06-07] Chat-based benchmark — switched from `/completion` to `/chat/completions` endpoint; benchmark now sends multi-turn chat requests with accumulated conversation history, extracts assistant response text, and reports `totalMessagesInContext` per message

### Changed

- [Changed]: [2026-06-07] Server lifecycle — `startLlamaServer()` now retries up to 5 times on port binding failures; `stopLlamaServer()` tries graceful `/shutdown` endpoint first then falls back to SIGTERM/SIGKILL; added `waitForPortFree()` to verify port is fully free (no TIME_WAIT)
- [Changed]: [2026-06-07] Pre-flight cleanup — added `ensureNoLlamaServer()` to detect and kill leftover llama-server processes before starting a new benchmark run; called in both `main()` and `runTestRun()`
- [Changed]: [2026-06-07] Signal handling — added SIGTERM, SIGINT, and uncaughtException handlers that gracefully stop llama-server and exit
- [Changed]: [2026-06-07] Server start logic — extracted `tryStartServer()` helper with early-death detection (3s timeout) and health polling; `startLlamaServer()` is now async with retry loop
- [Changed]: [2026-06-07] Test variable bounds — added `contextLengthMax`, `gpuLayerOffMax`, `batchSizeMax`, `uBatchSizeMax`, `cacheRamSMax` constants for future bound enforcement
- [Changed]: [2026-06-07] Results table — added "Messages in Context" column to per-message results markdown output
- [Changed]: [2026-06-07] Formatting — applied consistent line-break formatting to long if-statements and console.log calls in `getRunScript()` and `getServerParamsSnapshot()`
