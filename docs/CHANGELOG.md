# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- [Changed]: [2026-06-21] Renamed `src/benchmark/` to `src/backend/` — full directory rename across entire project; all path references updated in package.json, .gitignore, docs, library topics, scripts, api-server.js, and plan-pi-chat.md; frontend now lives at `src/backend/frontend/` instead of `src/benchmark/frontend/`

### Removed

- [Removed]: [2026-06-21] `.env.example` — removed root-level environment example file (settings now managed via `src/backend/frontend/.env.production` and runtime detection)

### Added

- [Added]: [2026-06-21] `src/backend/` — new backend directory containing the integrated benchmark server: `index.js` (benchmark runner spawning llama-server with grid search, health polling, and structured JSON output), `api-server.js` (Express API server with SSE streaming, REST endpoints for configs/profiles/reports/models/service control, Pi SDK agent session integration, HuggingFace model search/download, git update checking, and systemd service management), `scripts/update-api-url.sh` (auto-detects machine IP and updates frontend API URL)
- [Added]: [2026-06-21] `src/frontend/` — new frontend directory containing the Vue 3 SPA: Vite 6 build with Tailwind CSS 4, Pinia state management, Vue Router 4; views include Dashboard (benchmark run controls, live results table, system monitoring), Settings (visual config editor with tabs, build options, config profiles, actions panel), Reports (saved benchmark reports with sortable results table and launch command viewer), Models (HuggingFace model search/download with progress), Pi Chat (agent chat UI with Pi SDK sessions, SSE streaming, thinking blocks, tool calls, slash commands, skills autocomplete), Docs (markdown documentation viewer with cross-references), Logs (systemd service log viewer with auto-refresh); Pinia stores for benchmark state and Pi chat session management with localStorage persistence; reusable components (Tooltip, ConfigSection)
- [Added]: [2026-06-21] `.gitignore` — added exclusion rules for `src/backend/` generated files (llama.cpp, hf_downloads, node_modules, reports, results.md, .env, profiles) and `src/frontend/` generated files (node_modules, dist, env.*)
- [Added]: [2026-06-21] Pi Chat session persistence — the Pi chat window (homepage) now persists the session ID and message history to `localStorage`. On page reload or navigation back, the session and all previous messages are restored automatically. The SSE connection is reconnected to the existing server session. Clicking "New Session" clears the persisted data and starts fresh.
- [Added]: [2026-06-21] `.pi/APPEND_SYSTEM.md` — added system prompt append file directing the agent to consult `docs/` for comprehensive project documentation

### Fixed

- [Fixed]: [2026-06-21] Pi Chat — made chat window responsive on small viewports: root container now uses `min-h-0` for proper flex collapsing, input area and status footer marked `flex-shrink-0` so the New Session button and controls never bleed off the bottom, status footer wraps gracefully with `flex-wrap gap-2` on narrow screens
- [Fixed]: [2026-06-21] Pi Chat — added text wrapping to all markdown prose elements in `PiChat.vue`: `.pi-prose` container now uses `overflow-wrap: break-word` and `word-break: break-word` to prevent long words, URLs, and code from bleeding off screen; inline code, paragraphs, tables, and table cells all wrap; user and error message bubbles also wrapped with `break-words` class

### Added

- [Added]: [2026-06-21] Documentation overhaul — added frontmatter tags to all existing docs (USER-MANUAL.md, api-reference.md, config.md, configuration-reference.md, dashboard.md, models.md, reports.md, troubleshooting.md); restructured docs/index.md into Getting Started, Feature Documentation, Reference, Practical Examples, and Support sections; added new docs: architecture.md (system design with Mermaid diagrams), logs.md, pi-chat.md, tags.md (tags index); added QA example docs: qa-installation.md, qa-benchmark-run.md, qa-model-download.md, qa-troubleshooting.md; added library/tags.md for library topic cross-reference; fixed wiki link format across all docs (removed pipe labels, e.g., `[[Dashboard|Dashboard]]` → `[[dashboard]]`)
- [Added]: [2026-06-21] project-docs-lookup skill — new `.pi/skills/project-docs-lookup/` skill for looking up project documentation in docs/ and other sources when answering questions
- [Added]: [2026-06-21] AGENTS.md — added "Additional Documentation" section directing agents to consult `docs/` for comprehensive project documentation

### Changed

- [Changed]: [2026-06-21] docs/index.md — reorganized documentation index into categorized sections (Getting Started, Feature Documentation, Reference, Practical Examples, Support) with links to all existing and new pages

### Added

- [Added]: [2026-06-21] Project rules skill — new `project-rules` skill in `.pi/skills/project-rules/` containing all AGENTS.md rules for per-session auto-loading by the agent

### Changed

- [Changed]: [2026-06-21] Benchmark frontend — updated `VITE_API_URL` in `.env.production` from `100.88.77.33:3456` to `192.168.2.156:3456`

### Fixed

- [Fixed]: [2026-06-20] `package.json` — fixed JSON syntax error: removed stray quote character from `""version"` key (was `""version": "1.0.7"`, now `"version": "1.0.7"`)
- [Changed]: [2026-06-20] Version bump — `package.json` / `package-lock.json` bumped from `1.0.7` to `1.0.8`

### Fixed

- [Fixed]: [2026-06-20] Benchmark frontend — restructured `App.vue` layout to use proper flex column hierarchy (`flex flex-col min-h-0` on `<main>` and page content `<div>`), enabling child views to use `h-full` instead of hardcoded `calc(100vh - X)` height values; `PiChat.vue` updated to use `h-full`
- [Fixed]: [2026-06-20] Benchmark frontend — removed `p-6` padding class from the main page content container in `App.vue` to eliminate redundant default padding on the page body

### Changed

- [Changed]: [2026-06-20] Settings.vue Actions Panel — unified all action button styles from semantic colors (`btn-warning`, `btn-success`, `btn-primary`, `btn-error`) to `btn-ghost` for visual consistency

### Added

- [Added]: [2026-06-20] Reports page — clickable column headers in the Results Summary table enable sorting by #, Prompt/s, Gen/s, Time, and Mem (GB). Active sort column is highlighted with a direction indicator (↑/↓)
- [Added]: [2026-06-20] Benchmark frontend — version footer in the sidebar displays the app version (read from root `package.json` via Vite's `__APP_VERSION__` define); visible when sidebar is open

### Removed

- [Removed]: [2026-06-20] Benchmark frontend — removed version footer from the sidebar in `App.vue` (reverses the earlier addition of `v{{ __APP_VERSION__ }}` display)
- [Changed]: [2026-06-20] Version bump — `package.json` / `package-lock.json` bumped from `1.0.4` to `1.0.5`

### Changed

- [Changed]: [2026-06-20] `scripts/update.sh` — added `git stash` before `git pull` to prevent uncommitted local changes from blocking the update workflow

### Removed

- [Removed]: [2026-06-20] `src/backend/configs.json` — removed from git tracking and added both file and folder paths to `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits of local benchmark configuration

### Changed

- [Changed]: [2026-06-19] Settings.vue — moved Config Profiles panel from the left column to the right column; added `space-y-4` class to the right column wrapper so both columns have consistent vertical spacing between cards
- [Changed]: [2026-06-19] Settings.vue — moved action buttons (Kill Port, Start/Stop Service, Edit Service, Delete Build, Delete Llama) from the Editor card footer into a dedicated collapsible "Actions Panel" card in the left column; adds `showActionsPanel` ref for collapse/expand toggle; buttons now display vertically with full-width layout and status messages contained within the panel

### Fixed

- [Fixed]: [2026-06-19] Pi Chat — `expandPromptTemplates` is now `true` in the prompt endpoint so slash commands (e.g., `/skill:research`) are properly expanded before being sent to the agent
- [Fixed]: [2026-06-19] Settings.vue — wrapped left and right grid columns in proper `<div>` wrappers so the `lg:grid-cols-2` two-column layout renders correctly; left column includes Profile Panel and Build card with `space-y-4` spacing, right column contains the Editor card

### Changed

- [Changed]: [2026-06-19] Benchmark — increased llama-server health polling timeout from 2 minutes (120 retries) to 5 minutes (300 retries) to allow more time for model loading
- [Changed]: [2026-06-19] Frontend routing — renamed `/config` route to `/settings` (Config.vue → Settings.vue); made Pi Chat the home route (`/`) and moved Dashboard to `/benchmark`

### Added

- [Added]: [2026-06-19] Settings — "Update" button in the Actions Panel: pulls latest git changes and restarts `llama-benchmark.service`; includes confirmation dialog, loading state, and success/error feedback
- [Added]: [2026-06-19] Backend — `POST /api/update` endpoint that executes `scripts/update.sh` and returns output or error details
- [Changed]: [2026-06-19] `scripts/update.sh` — replaced `stop` + `start` with `systemctl --user restart llama-benchmark.service` for atomic service restart
- [Added]: [2026-06-19] Pi Chat — "New Session" button in the status footer: creates a fresh agent session (disposes current session, resets all state, connects new SSE stream); disabled while streaming to prevent mid-turn disruption
- [Added]: [2026-06-19] Pi Chat — skills autocomplete in slash menu: `GET /api/pi/skills` endpoint lists all discovered skills via `loadSkills()` from the Pi SDK; skills are fetched on session connect and appear in the slash dropdown under a "Skills" section with `/skill:<name>` labels; keyboard navigation (arrow keys, Enter/Tab) works across both commands and skills together
- [Added]: [2026-06-19] Pi Chat — slash command autocomplete in message input: typing `/` at the start of a line shows a dropdown of 23 Pi SDK commands (mirrors TUI `BUILTIN_SLASH_COMMANDS`) with two-column layout (`/command` + description), arrow-key navigation, Enter/Tab to select, Escape/outside-click to dismiss, substring filtering, and auto-dismiss on backspace
- [Added]: [2026-06-19] Pi Chat integration — new `/pi` route with full chat UI (`PiChat.vue`) backed by Pi SDK agent sessions; includes Pinia store (`pi-chat.js`) for SSE event handling, session lifecycle management, prompt/abort/dispose operations, markdown rendering, collapsible thinking blocks, and tool call visualization; backend endpoints in `api-server.js` for session creation (`POST /api/pi/session`), SSE streaming (`GET /api/pi/session/:id/stream`), prompting (`POST /api/pi/session/:id/prompt`), abort (`POST /api/pi/session/:id/abort`), and disposal (`DELETE /api/pi/session/:id`); added `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` SDK dependency and `dompurify` for safe markdown rendering

### Fixed

- [Fixed]: [2026-06-19] Pi Chat — `mapAgentEvent()` now correctly reads `event.message?.role` (instead of `event.role`) and `event.assistantMessageEvent?.delta` (instead of `event.text_delta`/`event.thinking_delta`) from Pi SDK events; user messages and assistant text now appear in the chat UI
- [Fixed]: [2026-06-19] Pi Chat — `AuthStorage` and `ModelRegistry` now load from `~/.pi/agent/auth.json` and `~/.pi/agent/models.json` respectively (via `getAgentDir()`), so the configured Ollama model is resolved and tokens are generated
- [Fixed]: [2026-06-19] Pi Chat — CORS configuration fixed: `origin: true` (reflects request origin) with `credentials: false` when wildcard, avoiding the invalid `*` + `credentials: true` anti-pattern
- [Fixed]: [2026-06-19] Pi Chat — removed hardcoded `VITE_API_URL` from `.env.development`; frontend uses relative URLs in dev mode. `.env.production` cleaned up (removed `VITE_PORT`/`VITE_HOST` settings) but retains production API URL
- [Fixed]: [2026-06-19] Pi Chat — assistant messages now render during SSE streaming; added `tick` counter to Pinia store to force computed re-evaluation when `currentAssistant` nested properties (`content`, `thinking`, `toolCalls`) are mutated by SSE events, which Vue's reactivity system previously missed because the object reference didn't change
- [Fixed]: [2026-06-18] `src/backend/index.js` — `generateMultiplicativeArray` now guards against degenerate multipliers (≤1), zero start values, and start > max to prevent infinite loops and `RangeError: Invalid array length`

### Added

- [Added]: [2026-06-18] Grid search benchmark mode — replaces sequential parameter stepping with full cartesian product grid search over context length, GPU layer offload, batch size, uBatch size, and cache RAM; includes progress indicator, grid size warnings, and multiplicative step support for context length

- [Added]: [2026-06-18] Default report filename in Dashboard.vue — auto-populates `reportName` with `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_<model>` format on mount, using the configured model name with sanitized characters

### Changed

- [Changed]: [2026-06-18] Renamed `deep-research` skill to `research` — moved from `.pi/skills/deep-research/` to `.pi/skills/research/` with updated name in frontmatter and heading; functionality unchanged
- [Changed]: [2026-06-18] `src/backend/index.js` — replaced `Math.min` with explicit `>=` comparison for batch size, uBatchSize, and cacheRam boundary checks to correctly cap at maximum when step would exceed it

### Added

- [Added]: [2026-06-18] GPU Layer Offload controls in Config.vue — three new inputs for `gpu_layer_offload`, `gpu_layer_offload_step`, and `gpu_layer_offload_max` in the Test Parameters section; removed `gpu_layer_offload` from the build params select list

- [Added]: [2026-06-18] Custom CUDA architecture input — new text field in Config.vue to specify CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES value (e.g. "86-real;120-real") instead of hardcoding it; value is used in both build script and cmake flags snapshot

### Added

- [Added]: [2026-06-18] Service start button — new "Start llama.service" button in Config.vue controls panel that starts the systemd service; only visible when benchmark is not running and service is inactive; paired with existing stop button

### Fixed

- [Fixed]: [2026-06-18] `scripts/install-service.sh` — service file PATH now derived from the actual npm binary location at install time instead of hardcoding the nvm node path, resolving 'env: node: No such file or directory' failures on machines with different nvm setups

### Added

- [Added]: [2026-06-18] Systemd service logs page — new `/logs` route in benchmark frontend with `Logs.vue` component that fetches and displays `journalctl` output from `llama.service` with auto-refresh (5s), auto-scroll toggle, and manual refresh button; backed by new `GET /api/logs` endpoint in `api-server.js`

- [Added]: [2026-06-18] Systemd service editor — new "Edit Service" button in Config.vue configs panel that opens a modal for editing the installed llama.service (ExecStart command, environment variables, restart policy); shows "No service installed" message if no service exists; saves trigger daemon-reload and restart; backed by `GET /api/service/config` and `POST /api/service/update` endpoints

### Changed

- [Changed]: [2026-06-18] CUDA installation replaced with version-specific scripts — deleted `scripts/init-cuda.sh` (CUDA 13.2); added `scripts/init-cuda13.3.sh` (CUDA 13.3 for newer GPUs) and `scripts/init-cuda12.9.sh` (CUDA 12.9 for older GPUs); updated `install.sh` menu to offer both CUDA versions separately, with 12.9 excluded from "Run all" due to conflicts
- [Changed]: [2026-06-18] `src/backend/api-server.js` — removed `export` prefix from environment variable lines in `getLaunchCommand()` (they are now `KEY=VALUE` pairs joined with `&&`); simplified `command` field to use plain `join(" ")` instead of `join(" \\\")`

### Fixed

- [Fixed]: [2026-06-18] `src/backend/index.js` and `api-server.js` — tensor split parameter now uses `sps.tensor_split.value` exclusively (removed auto-calculated `tensorSplitValue` fallback); applies to `getRunScript()`, `getServerParamsSnapshot()`, `runTestRun()`, `getLaunchCommand()`, and `extractConfigsPerRun()`
- [Fixed]: [2026-06-18] `scripts/install-service.sh` — `llama-benchmark.service` now uses absolute path to `npm` and sets explicit `PATH` environment variable so systemd can find the nvm-installed node executable (was failing with exit code 203/EXEC)

### Added

- [Added]: [2026-06-18] Git update feature — new `POST /api/git/update` endpoint that pulls latest changes and restarts the llama.service; "Update Available" button in sidebar triggers the update; toast notification banner with success/error feedback
- [Added]: [2026-06-18] `CUDA_SCALE_LAUNCH_QUEUES` now uses a select dropdown with configurable queue options (1x, 4x, 8x) in Config.vue

### Fixed

- [Fixed]: [2026-06-18] `frontend/src/stores/benchmark.js` — `saveReport` now sends `{}` when no name provided instead of `{ name: undefined }`, preventing undefined name in saved reports; caller in Dashboard.vue passes `reportName.value` directly

### Added

- [Changed]: [2026-06-18] configs.json — updated CUDA version from 13.2 to 13.3 (`cuda_version` and `cudacxx` path); enabled `enable_cuda_graphs`; disabled `enable_cuda_per_max_batch_size`, `enable_cuda_peer_copy`, and `enable_cuda_scheduled_max_copies`

- [Fixed]: [2026-06-13] Missing closing `</div>` tag in Dashboard.vue template that caused Vue render errors

### Added

- [Added]: [2026-06-13] `.gitignore` for benchmark frontend to exclude local `.env` files while keeping `.env.example`

- [Added]: [2026-06-13] Structured benchmark message streaming — `BENCHMARK_JSON:` prefixed JSON lines emitted from `index.js` during benchmark runs, carrying `message-start`, `message-complete`, and `test-run-complete` events with full prompt/response text, token counts, and timing
- [Added]: [2026-06-13] `GET /api/messages` endpoint — REST endpoint returning all collected benchmark messages (test prompts and LLM responses) grouped by test run ID
- [Added]: [2026-06-13] Benchmark messages viewer in Dashboard — right-column panel displaying structured test run messages with prompt/response pairs, token counts, timing, and per-message badges
- [Added]: [2026-06-13] SSE event listeners for `message-start`, `message-complete`, and `test-run-complete` in the Pinia store; `fetchMessages()` and `clearMessages()` store actions

### Changed

- [Changed]: [2026-06-13] `api-server.js` — added `benchmarkMessages` and `currentTestRunMessages` arrays; `parseBenchmarkJSON()` function to extract structured JSON from benchmark stdout; reset message arrays on new benchmark start
- [Changed]: [2026-06-13] `index.js` — emit `BENCHMARK_JSON:` structured messages at message-start, message-complete, and test-run-complete points, with proper escaping for embedded quotes and newlines
- [Changed]: [2026-06-13] Dashboard layout — reorganized from stacked single-column to two-column grid (results/logs on left, messages on right); combined metrics into single card with run count; added collapsible log viewer with maximize/minimize toggle and line numbers
- [Changed]: [2026-06-13] Benchmark frontend dist — rebuilt with updated asset hashes (`index-oSA0TkQC.js`, `index-FnvWUHyx.css`)

### Fixed

- [Fixed]: [2026-06-13] Duplicate `.env.production` file renamed to `.env.productions` (typo) — both files are now tracked

### Added

- [Added]: [2026-06-11] Standalone benchmark API server — restored `api-server.js` (Express server with SSE streaming, REST API, config CRUD, results retrieval, report management, build endpoint, clone endpoint, and kill-port endpoint)
- [Added]: [2026-06-11] Standalone benchmark Vue 3 frontend — restored `frontend/` as a Vue 3 SPA with Vite 6, Pinia, Vue Router 4, and Tailwind CSS 4; Dashboard, Config, and Reports views with real-time SSE streaming
- [Added]: [2026-06-11] Benchmark npm package — new `package.json` with Express, axios, cors, dotenv, and express-rate-limit dependencies; scripts for `dev`, `dev:frontend`, `build:frontend`, and `start`

### Changed

- [Changed]: [2026-06-11] `.gitignore` — added `src/backend/frontend/dist/` to exclude future frontend build artifacts; current dist files are committed as initial seed

### Removed

- [Removed]: [2026-06-18] Old documentation — deleted docs/CHANGELOG.md (merged into src/backend/docs/CHANGELOG.md), architecture.md, backend/ directory (9 files), llama.cpp_docs/ directory (20 files), frontend-improvements-report.md, old docs/index.md
- [Removed]: [2026-06-11] Reverted removal of standalone benchmark frontend — undoes the earlier decision to remove `frontend/` and `api-server.js`; the benchmark is now available as both a standalone tool and through the main Betty web interface

### Changed

- [Changed]: [2026-06-09] Default the configuration editor to visual mode instead of JSON mode
- [Fixed]: [2026-06-09] Initialize visual config state from store on mount for proper two-way binding

### Added

- [Added]: [2026-06-09] Comprehensive Build Settings section in Config.vue with toggle controls for basic build options (ccache, LTO), CUDA options (Flash Attention, CUDA Graphs, NCCL, peer copy, custom arch, FP16, etc.), build parameter inputs (peer batch size, max scheduled copies, compression level), quantization & precision toggles, and CUDA configuration fields (CUDA version, NVCC path)
- [Added]: [2026-06-09] `normalizeBuildParams` function to convert flat build/CUDA params into visual-enabled format with enabled/value structure
- [Added]: [2026-06-09] `flattenBuildParams` function to convert visual-enabled params back to flat format before saving
- [Added]: [2026-06-09] `toggleBuildParam`, `updateBuildParamValue`, `toggleCudaConfig`, and `updateCudaConfigValue` helper functions for visual config interaction

### Added

- [Added]: [2026-06-10] Configurable benchmark messages via `benchmark_messages` in configs.json, DEFAULT_CONFIGS, and UI in Config.vue for editing messages used to fill context during benchmarking
- [Added]: [2026-06-10] Auto-save report functionality (`saveReport`) that persists benchmark results to JSON after each test run completes, with automatic report naming based on date and model

### Changed

- [Changed]: [2026-06-10] Benchmark messages in index.js now read from configs instead of being hardcoded, with fallback to defaults

### Added

- [Added]: [2026-06-10] `--build-only` CLI flag to build llama.cpp using `configs.json` settings and exit without running benchmark tests
- [Added]: [2026-06-10] Build llama.cpp button in Config.vue with real-time SSE progress bar and build log viewer; backed by `POST /api/build` endpoint

### Added

- [Added]: [2026-06-10] Config profiles system — save, load, and delete benchmark configuration profiles via UI in Config.vue and API endpoints (`/api/profiles`, `/api/profile`, `/api/profile/:name`, `/api/profile/:name/load`), with profiles stored as JSON files in `profiles/` directory
- [Added]: [2026-06-10] Clone repository feature — modal UI in benchmark frontend with SSE-based progress streaming, supporting URL, branch, and target directory inputs; backed by `POST /api/clone` endpoint that spawns git clone with shallow depth and real-time log output
